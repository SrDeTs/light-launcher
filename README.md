LightLauncher is a games launcher designed to run non-Steam games on Linux using **umu** (Unified Linux Runtime). It provides a seamless way to manage and execute Windows applications through Proton without needing the Steam client to be active for each session.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This project is still in **early development**. You may encounter bugs or breaking changes. Feel free to report issues or contribute!

> [!NOTE]
>
> The name **LightLauncher** comes from the word **"Go"** (as in "Go for it!"), representing the ability to launch Proton immediately. It's also a happy coincidence that the project is built using the **Go (Golang)** programming language! XD

## FEATURES

- **Independent Instance Manager** – Each game runs as a standalone detached process. Closing the main launcher does not affect running games.
- **Multi-Game Support** – Run multiple Windows applications simultaneously with unique Proton configurations and prefixes.
- **Process Isolation** – Every game gets its own System Tray icon for individual management (Graceful Stop/Status).
- **Native Terminal Integration** – Real-time logs are piped to your preferred terminal (Kitty, Alacritty, etc.) for live debugging.
- **Automatic Log Management** – Persistent logging to `~/LightLauncher/logs` with automatic rotation (keeps last 10 sessions)
- **umu-run Core** – Utilizes the Unified Linux Runtime (umu) to provide superior execution for non-Steam games.
- **Shared Prefix Architecture** – Supports mapping individual or shared prefix environments interchangeably across different Proton versions seamlessly.

## ARCHITECTURE & EFFICIENCY

1. **UI (Wails/Go):** Used only for configuration. It **closes completely** after launching a game, freeing all WebKit memory.
2. **Instance Manager (`light-launcher-instance`):** A tiny Go binary that manages the process life-cycle and tray.

## PREREQUISITES

- **umu-launcher** (Required for execution)
- **Steam** (Installed and configured)
- **ProtonPlus** (Recommended for managing and adding Proton versions)

> [!TIP]
>
> Use **ProtonPlus** or **Steam** to download and install different Proton versions. LightLauncher will automatically detect them in your Steam compatibility tools directory.
